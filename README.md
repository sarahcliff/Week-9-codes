# Week-9-codes
All codes from week 4 to week 9


Here you will find 3 codes. 1 to process and deseason the data gathered from the sentinel script, one to check if the sentinel data is correct (and that I made significant changes to to try and fix a bug), and one to do cross correlation, autocorrelation, and ARIMA analysis on the data.
